Getting Started with Sphinx

Creating and Building Content
******************************

I followed these steps to create and build content in Sphinx.

1. Create content in .rst files and save in a folder:_sphinx-docs in the source folder.

2. Add path and file names (without file extension) to toctree.

3. Make a build.

To make a build, type in the command line:

$ make.bat html

Sphinx builds your content.
