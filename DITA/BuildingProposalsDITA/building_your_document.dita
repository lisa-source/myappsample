        tracks your progress with checkmarks along the document outline. Once all the information is
        complete, all the data screens and outline sections will have checkmarks, and you can build
        the document.</shortdesc>

                <info>Acme Eye creates your document in Microsoft Word for you. While your document
                    builds, an hourglass icon appears on your Build Document screen. When your document is finished
                    building, the hourglass icon goes away. A 2MB document builds in around 20
                    seconds.</info>
