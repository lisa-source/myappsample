# How to Prepare a Global Knowledge Transfer
The global knowledge transfer sessions, known as Acme Engineer Academy, are monthly webinar sessions hosted by the virtual team program lead. Topics are defined by the virtual team program lead, business unit, or suggestions from the survey results. The target audience is the virtual team members who are engineers, but all are welcome! ðŸ˜ƒ

Presenters range from the business unit, R&D, technical marketing, CTO, or engineer community. The presentations and recordings are posted on the Engineer Central website in HTML. Note: This information will not be posted to [GitHub](http://github.com). The following is the detailed process on how to prepare a global knowledge transfer.

## Acme Engineer Academy Detailed Process
The following are the detailed steps involved to host a global Acme Engineer Academy knowledge transfer.  

1. Topics submitted by virtual team lead, business unit, or survey.         
Obtain a list of topics from the virtual team theatre and area leads, business unit, or survey results.  

1. Prioritize topics and identify presenters by topic.   
With the help of the virtual team lead, business unit, executive sponsor, and trusted advisor, prioritize the list of topics and identify the potential presenters.  
For example, you may prioritize a topic over another because the product will be generally available in the coming month and the virtual team needs to be trained on the upcoming release.  

1. Presenters confirm they can conduct the session and topic was vetted by the engineer virtual team.
    * When the potential presenters are identified in step 2, contact them via email or phone to request them to present the topic on an Acme Engineer Academy session. Sometimes, you might need to conduct a small meeting to cover all the points.  
    * When you originally reach out to the potential presenters, inform them of:  
	    - the topic  
	    - if applicable, list of questions, sub-topic, and comments the potential presenters need to cover during the Acme Engineer Academy session.  
    * When the potential presenters confirm they will conduct the Acme Engineer Academy session, obtain the following information:  

    | Title of the Session | |
    | ------ | ------ |
    | **Description of the Session** |  |
    | **Presenter Names** |  |
    | **Assistant with Q&A** |  |
    | **Duration** | 60, 90, or 120 minutes? |
    | **Conference Platform** | Acme Widget |
    | **Date and Time** | <Enter date and time> |
    | **Presentation Due** | <Enter due date for presentation> |
